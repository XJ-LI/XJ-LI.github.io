# About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Emory University's Department of Mathematics. My advisor is Lars Ruthotto. My current research involves using deep 
learning based methods for PDE and optimal control related mathematical problems. I received my B.S. from Xiamen University in China.

# Research

My research focuses mainly on incorporating deep learning techniques into solving PDE and optimal control problems, specifically I am interested in tackling high dimensional optimal control problems where common numerical methods are insufficient. I also have a general interest in Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
